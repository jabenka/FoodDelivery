# FoodDelivery
My first project using spring
it was hard for me and i really didnt expect so much pain in it(databases only i guess) so its just a small web-site where you could order some food by typing its name
# 
I tried my best
# 
For database i tried H2 but it wanst good for me,i created it with help of IDEA and i just cant imagine why data is not inserting into the data base,i created table and view and threre is still nothing so i gave up this idea(maybe in web-console data is inserting,idk i didnt check it)
#
On the next day i tried it with mysql database and it worked! After hard night of trying to repair h2 i gave up and npw with mysql everything works just fine
